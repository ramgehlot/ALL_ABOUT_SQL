What is SQL Server?
=It is a software, developed by Microsoft, which is implemented from the specification of RDBMS.

SQL Server Components : SQL Server works in client-server architecture, hence it supports two types of components − (a) Workstation and (b) Server.
=Workstation components are installed in every device/SQL Server operator’s machine. These are just interfaces to interact with Server components. Example: SSMS, SSCM, Profiler, BIDS, SQLEM etc.
=Server components are installed in centralized server. These are services. Example: SQL Server, SQL Server Agent, SSIS, SSAS, SSRS, SQL browser, SQL Server full text search etc.

SQL Server is available in various editions. 
=Enterprise,Standard,Developer,Workgroup,Win Compact Edition - Mobile,Enterprise Evaluation,Express,Web,Datacenter,Business Intelligenc.

The architecture of SQL Server is
=General architecture
=Memory architecture
=Data file architecture
=Log file architecture

SQL SERVER BASICS : 
-Querying data= SELECT.
-Sorting data= ORDER BY
-Limiting rows= OFFSET FETCH ,SELECT TOP.
-Filtering data = DISTINCT ,WHERE , AND, OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, 
-Joining tables = Joins ,INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN , RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN, SELF JOIN .
-Grouping data =GROUP BY, HAVING ,GROUPING SETS , CUBE , ROLLUP.
-Subquery = Subquery , Correlated subquery, EXISTS , ANY, ALL.
-Set Operators = UNION , INTERSECT , EXCEPT.
-Common Table Expression (CTE)= CTE , Recursive CTE.
-Pivot = PIVOT 
-Modifying data = INSERT, INSERT multiple rows, INSERT INTO SELECT, UPDATE, UPDATE JOIN , DELETE ,MERGE.
-Data definition = CREATE, DROP DATABASE ,CREATE , ALTER, DROP SCHEMA, CREATE TABLE, Identity column, Sequence, ALTER TABLE ADD column,ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN , 
 ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN , Computed columns, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE ,SELECT INTO , Rename a table, Temporary tables , Synonym.
-SQL Server Data Types = BIT , INT, DECIMAL, CHAR, NCHAR, VARCHAR, NVARCHAR, DATE, DATETIME2, TIME, DATETIMEOFFSET, GUID.
-Constraints = Primary key , Foreign key, NOT NULL constraint , UNIQUE constraint, CHECK constraint.
-Expressions = CASE , COALESCE , NULLIF .

The Select Statement =:= SQL Server processes the FROM clause first and then the SELECT clause even though the SELECT clause appears first in the query.
should not use the SELECT * for real production code due to the following main reasons:
First, SELECT * often retrieves more data than your application needs to function. 
It causes unnecessary data to transfer from the SQL Server to the client application, taking more time for data to travel across the network and slowing down the application.
Second, if the table is added one or more new columns, theSELECT * just retrieves all columns that include the newly added columns which were not intended for use in the application. This could make the application crash.

SQL Server Views : 
A view is select query which is stored under the tag VIEW as to save time and execute the same query again and again.
Example : When you use the SELECT statement to query data from one or more tables, you get a result set. if you want to get the same result set,you can save the code in view and execute it.

Advantages of views : 
Security : You can restrict users to access directly to a table and allow them to access a subset of data via views.
Simplicity : you can simplify the complex queries with joins and conditions using a set of views.
Consistency : ometimes, you need to write a complex formula or logic in every query.To make it consistent, you can hide the complex queries logic and calculations in views.Once views are defined, you can reference the logic from the views rather than rewriting it in separate queries.

View operation : 
=Creating a new view 
=Renaming a view
=Listing views in SQL Server 
=Getting view information 
=Removing a view 
=Creating an indexed view 
=Renaming a view 
=Listing views in SQL Server
=Getting view information 
=Removing a view
Creating an new view
